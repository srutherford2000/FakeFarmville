Game Title: FakeFarmville

Description: 
This is an idle game where you harvest crops and complete orders (when the truck drives up). By completing orders, you can buy more fields, which makes it easier to harvest more crops and complete more orders etc. It is based on the FarmVille app that I played for a little bit.

Controls: 
It is a keyboard arrows (or wsad) controlled game. You used the arrows to move the player around. If you hit a crop in the field you will harvest it, if you step on a blue replant the field square the crops on the corresponding field will have its plants regenerate, if you step on a purple buy a new field square and you 10 moneys a new field will appear, if you step on a red square the crops will pass from being held by the user to being put in the boxes for a truck to take as part of an order.
General user flow:
1. User gets a task from the truck(appears in the bottom left corner) 
2. User moves through the field hitting crops and is now holding them
3. User moves goes to all the red squares to put the crops into the boxes 
4a. User has completed the task, received money and buys new fields and waits for step 1.
4b. The user has not completed the task, goes back to replants fields and goes back to step 2.
